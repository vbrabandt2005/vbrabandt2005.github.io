## Hello there, Welcome to my new personal blog

### Why did I create this site?

I intended to create this site as an experiment and as a way to express myself without relying on social media, most social media sites in my opinion are no longer designed for long posts any more.

### Why did I choose GitHub pages + Jekyll instead of another service?

Well firstly, I confess I can't afford a personal domain yet, so that explains why I'm using GitHub pages (plus I really like the openness of GitHub/Open-source).

I admit I have no experience at UI design (& I'm sorry, but I don't want to ever get into HTML/CSS), I just want a simple blog style site with a minimalist/utilitarian kinda feel, but I found Squarespace/Wix to be designed more for portfolios and businesses, I once had a WordPress site, but I didn't enjoy its editor.

My plan is I will my make blog with GitHub Pages and one day I will make a portfolio/CV website on either Squarespace or Wix.

### What to expect?

I don't have a plan planned out, but I've been thinking of writing about:

- **Personal life**
  - Love of Capybaras
- **Music**
  - Album/Song reviews/analyses
  - Musical equipment usage/review
  - Music production
- **Films/TV Shows**
  - Film reviews/analyses
  - TV Shows reviews/analyses
  - Anime reviews/analyses
- **Video Games**
  - Video Game reviews/analyses
- **Computer stuff**
  - Computer hardware repair/maintenance
  - Computers (parts & equipment) reviews
  - Operating System reviews
  - Programming
  - Game Console stuff (also maybe)

### Are things here open-source?

Answer is most will be, but I'm still learning about licences and I will probably keep some stuff (such as photos/audio) copyrighted, but if you need anything from a post then feel free to ask for permission.

### A note on commenting

I just found out that I can allow commenting on the site, but I've decided to turn it off for now, but will probably enable it later
