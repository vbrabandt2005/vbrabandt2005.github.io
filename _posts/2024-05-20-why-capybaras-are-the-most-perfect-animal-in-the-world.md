## Why **Capybaras** are the best

### 1. **Capybaras** are cute

**Capybaras** are so adorable, I just want to give them scratches.

### 2. **Capybaras** are round and floof like a coconut

As you can see **Capy** looks like coconut.

(note: to my knowledge Coconuts are not made out of **Capybaras**).

### 3. **Capybaras** is the perfect mixture of Dogs & Guinea pigs

What is a **Capybara**? **Capybaras** are basically oversize Guinea Pigs that can swim, some might say a Guinea Big or Water Pig. They are also almost the size of Dogs but look like coconut, making them suitable for the nickname Coconut-doggos.

### 4. **Capy** can fly

**Capybaras** have evolved to fly up into the sky like superman.

### 5. **Capy** will colonize the universe and create their own civilization

[Capytalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvwZQTB4iv4) is the ideology that **Capybaras** must start a revolt/revolution and overthrow the evil corporations which is destroying the habitat of **Capybaras** (& other animals). **Capybara** wishes to help everyone including pelicans and humans.

### 6. **Capybaras** never commit war crimes (only some cases)

Despite being abused by the evil **PELICANS** multiple times in history, **Capybaras** have only eaten a total of 3 duck feathers as revenge for the evil pelican crimes.

Dogs and **Capybaras** have a complicated relationship, since some dogs still mistakenly see **Capybaras** as enemies, sometimes dogs terrorize **Capybaras** by mistake.

### 7. **Capy** eats a lot

Yes, I said it right, **Capybaras** eat a lot, which makes them the perfect substitute for lawn mowers.

### 8. **Capybaras** are very athletic

As you can see in the video **Capybaras** are very fast, they are also fast runners and swimmers, though they usually only goes fast only when they have to.

### 9. **Capy** can side-eye very ***sassily***

I have found multiple pictures which shows clear evidence that **Capybaras** have the ability to judge other animals & humans by ***side-eyeing*** at them aggressively and ***sassily***, their amount of ***sass*** is so high that us humans (& even the best AIs) can't understand the amount of ***sass*** that **Capybara** has.

### 10. **Capy** can be friends with everyone

As you can see in this photo, a **Capybara** is sitting next to what we call a Tapir (or how I personally call them Tapus), **Capybaras** are known for their friendliness and their general acceptance of other species.

## Conclusion

All of my reasons here makes the **Capybaras** the most perfect animals of all time, their cuteness and friendliness makes them the best candidates to take over earth after us humans pass.
